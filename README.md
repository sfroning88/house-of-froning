# README.md

Personal website for **Sean Froning** deployed to `house-of-froning.vercel.app` with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Cursor

This is a `pnpm workspace` with `Next.js` configuration. Follow the `apps-rules.mdc` religiously. I am building a personal website to show off some pictures, my achievements, and attract like-minded folk who want to build cool shit with me.
